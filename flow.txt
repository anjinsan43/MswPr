intro screen>>[pick size,seed, num of mines] or [quit]
<intro screen dynamically updates entry boxes with (%_of_mines to num_of_mines) vs (x*y), rounded>

    create [mine_field]
        if rand < (mines/num_of_sq):
            mine
        else:
            no mine

        create button with x,y call-back
        translator function? returns x,y??
        a 'translator' would get called with x,y as params
        and then?? do what? leftclick is open sqr, game over
        if mine. right click is just flag/question-mark.
        just need to keep track of each square's info which 
        gets changed from left/right click.
        
        
    parse_mine_field
        update sqr_dict[x#y#].prox_num
